## 🎯 Smart Booking Strategy Implemented

### For Most Visitors (Primary Flow)

1. They see "Book a Call" or "Book a Free Call"
2. Clicking opens Ale's calendar: `https://cal.com/ale-boba-work/15min`
3. Clear messaging: "Schedule with our Chief Revenue Officer"
4. Availability shown: "10 AM - 3 PM"

### For Enterprise/High-Touch Clients

1. Contact page shows two options
2. Primary button: "Schedule with Ale" (larger, more prominent)
3. Secondary button: "Enterprise & Fractional CTO" (smaller, subtle)
4. Opens Eliaz's limited availability calendar for strategic discussions

### Benefits of This Approach

- ✅ Ale handles high volume of leads (her main role)
- ✅ Eliaz's calendar only for qualified enterprise/CTO inquiries
- ✅ Clear role separation and expectations set
- ✅ Availability transparency builds trust
- ✅ Two-tier approach filters leads appropriately

---

## 🔄 Title Recommendation

### Current: "Chief Sales Officer (CSO)"

### Recommended: **"Chief Revenue Officer (CRO)"**

**Why CRO is better:**

- More modern and comprehensive role title
- Encompasses sales + customer success + growth
- Higher perceived value in tech/startup space
- Reflects strategic responsibility beyond just closing deals
- Used by top agencies and startups

**Updated throughout the site as "Chief Revenue Officer"**
